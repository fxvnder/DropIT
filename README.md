# DropIT

### Project made for FIKALAB ISEC_CHALLENGE 2021 by Critical Software.

#### Made by João "FXVNDER" Oliveira and João "Yeshey" Almeida.

##### Won the "People's Choice" award... which was a 5 quilogram Toblerone chocolate. [I'm not joking.](https://i.imgur.com/XowkPBa.jpg)

--------------------------------------------

DropIT exists because you see water waste every single day of your life, and we had enough of it! Our project would be a fix to a LOT of society problems, preventing water waste, managing farms and greenhouses directly on your phone, being able to detect how your plants, vegetables, etc. are growing in real-time, while you're on the other side of the world and directly ordering your water sprinklers to work... or NOT!

Our project works using a DHT22, which detects the air temperature and humidity, and a Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor, which measures the soil humidity with much more precision. All of these are connected to a ESP32 arduino connected to LoRa, which will send the signals of the sensors to TheThingsNetwork, and then, we will receive the data, and "make things happen", from sending emails and/or push notifications on your cellphone about how "wet" things are, but also warn you if you're, for example, watering your plants too much... or NOT too much, and, of course, checking if your grandma keeps watering the plants you already watered.

The main goal of our project was to make every single busy life person, such as college students (lol), a possible mission to grow a cactus without it dying in a month! Yes,... a cactus... I'm joking! Am I?, well, the uses are INFINITE! In a personal level, you can use it to manage your home plants, but it can, of course, have industrial level usage, such as monitoring gigantic greenhouses, powerfarms, etc., all by looking at your smartphone! Ain't you tired of seeing sprinklers working while it's raining bullets from the sky? We want to end that! Our sensor will tell you "Bro, it's raining. Please don't.", is it that hard?

All of this while being much more green-friendly, as we use solar-powered energy (in urgent cases, or if you live in Greenland or something, you can charge the battery with a regular USB, of course). But the plan is simple, pick it up, put it in your grandma's farm, tweak it on your phone, and it's done! No more manual tweeking and no more complicating an easy task!
